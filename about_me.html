    <h2>Jael Nascimento</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Jael. I'm 38 years old. I have been marrid for 3 years and we will have our first baby next month. </p>
    <p> I'm from Brazil. I already have a degree in business administration and I have been working with business intelligence for over 6 years. I always liked technology a lot, today I work in a development company and that made me want to learn more about it. </p>
    <p>The last pathconnect module was a big challenge for me, I had to work late for many days and it made my studies very difficult.</p>
    <p> I felt that no matter how much I studied things didn't cross my mind, but after completing the module I felt more confident.</p>
    <p>I felt that all the efforts were worth it and I felt the Lord by my side 
        guiding me and completing all that I could not do for myself. I know that I will have many challenges until the end of the course, but I also know that the Lord will always strengthen and help us in all challenges.</p>
